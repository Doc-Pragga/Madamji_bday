    <h1>OUR FIRST DATE</h1>
    <p>I realised that day one thing.... you were hella cute.... maybe because I liked you so much but I was lost in those eyes like I don't even remember half the things you said..... I was just lost seeing my future with you</p>
    <p>And surprisingly.... the things which most girls didn't like in general, you liked them a lot about me..... That day I realised that I found the right girl madamjiiii</p>
