    <h1>Till Forever</h1>
    <p>I know life isn't always perfect, but with you, itâ€™s always worth it.</p>
    <p>I would end up making a 100 slides baby..... but I just want you to know that at this point I couldn't even imagine a future without you.... I know this sounds cliche.... but trust me madam ji, when I say this, Even thinking about a life without you has become a nightmare for me....</p>
    <p>I know for a fact that you have different perspective on how things should go.... you are taking your time and I appreciate it.... and waiting for you has been the best period of my entire life.... and I would continue to do for the rest of my life, if that's what it takes and if it means I'll be with you...</p>
    <p>But still curiosity lurks.... remember you said you needed 6 months for a person to know well?</p>
    <p>Do I qualify as an honourable person to be able to be called "My Man, My Boyfriend, My Future Husband", from you?</p>
    <p>You know I won't get to know the answer to the question, I might ask once about what you answered, but you need not tell me what you answered, it'll be with you and only with you.....</p>
    <p>So madam ji, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU FOREVER till my last breath</p>
    <p>But do you love me? Can I officially call you my girlfriend?</p>
